## ACG_AWS_Certified_Solutions_Architect_Associate_SAA-C02

I will be documenting my process of the AWS Solutions Architect course from [Acloudguru](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/overview) here

All content is from acloudguru

Main topics to focus on are
- S3
- Route 53
- VPC

Try to document lab exercises to show proof of concepts

## VPC
